        <h3>Hello! I’m a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in technology, innovation, and creative problem-solving. My academic background provided me with a solid foundation in computer science principles, including algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, databases, and software engineering.

Throughout my studies, I’ve explored a variety of technologies and tools, gaining hands-on experience with languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Django. I’ve also worked with SQL and NoSQL databases and have a growing interest in cloud platforms like AWS and Firebase.

What drives me most is the opportunity to build things that matter—applications and systems that solve real problems, improve user experiences, or simply make tasks more efficient. I enjoy both front-end and back-end development and have taken part in several projects ranging from web applications and API design to data analysis and machine learning experiments.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others, share ideas, and iterate quickly. At the same time, I’m equally comfortable working independently—diving deep into documentation, debugging tricky issues, or experimenting with new tools. I'm always eager to learn and grow, whether that’s through personal projects, open-source contributions, or ongoing professional development.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring tech blogs, trying out new software, or thinking up ideas for my next project. I believe in continuous learning and am excited to contribute to innovative teams that value creativity, clarity, and impact.
